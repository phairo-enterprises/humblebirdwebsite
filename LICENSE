### Phairo Universal License (PUL) v1.0

---

#### **Preamble**

The Phairo Universal License (PUL) is more than just a legal framework. It embodies the ethos of Phairo Enterprises, aiming to redefine the standards of intellectual property, collaboration, and trust in the digital age. With the core principles of Uknowme at its foundation, this license aims to create a landscape where creators are recognized, users are empowered, and the balance between open access and rightful recognition is preserved.

#### **1. Definitions**

- **"Work"** refers to any intellectual creation, whether it's software, text, artwork, or other forms of content.
- **"Creator"** refers to the individual or entity that has originated or produced the Work.
- **"User"** refers to anyone who uses, interacts with, or benefits from the Work.

#### **2. Grant of Rights**

1. **Open Access**: The Work can be freely accessed, used, and shared by any User.
2. **Modification & Derivation**: Users can modify or create derivative works based on the original Work. However, all modifications or derivatives must duly recognize and credit the original Creator.

---

#### **3. Recognition & Attribution**

While the Work is freely available, the principles of Uknowme require that Users:

1. Always credit the original Creator when using or sharing the Work.
2. Never misrepresent the origin or ownership of the Work.
3. If available, use the Uknowme authentication system for validation and verification when distributing or sharing the Work.

#### **4. Community Responsibility**

1. **Accountability**: Membership to the Uknowme system emphasizes accountability. Users should approach this license with the understanding that actions hold weight, including misuse or misrepresentation of the Work.
2. **Vouching**: In the spirit of the Uknowme ethos, those who vouch for others within the ecosystem carry a responsibility. Misuse by one can have repercussions for those who introduced or vouched for the misusing party.

#### **5. Warranty & Liability**

The Work is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the Creator be liable for any claim, damages, or other liabilities, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Work.

#### **6. Future Versions of This License**

Phairo Enterprises may release updated versions of the PUL. When doing so, Phairo will make efforts to distinguish between different versions for clarity.
